        <h1>Arts Faculty</h1>
        <p>The light of knowledge blossomed and the flame of heritage blended with modernity crystallized and embraced at the Amman Alchemy University since 1991. It was then settled at the Faculty of Arts and became available to our students by a scientific edifice equipped with all modern educational tools and technology. Our students have gained knowledge from a group of university professors who were carefully chosen by the University Administration from different disciplines to achieve the University mission and vision statements. The foundation of this vision was based on excellence and creativity in delivering education and scientific research in the academic programmes available at the Faculty of Arts. The university mission consists of establishing a pioneering educational environment that takes its students towards creativity in developing their scientific research skills and methods, and in improving education outcomes and linking them to the needs of our local community.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Faculty of Arts at Amman Alchemy University is based on four main pillars: Department of Arabic Language and Literature, Department of English Language with its two main branches: (Department of English Language and Literature and Department of Translation), Department of Psychology, and Department of Service Courses. These departments co-exist and collaborate in choosing their study plans and curriculum by bearing in mind the needs of our students at the Faculty. These courses aim to develop student cognitive awareness and build positive trends towards contemporary life, based on the ethical values ​​of our society. Our primary aim focuses on enriching and developing student linguistic, literary, and critical skills. We also aim to continue develop our bachelor's and master's degree programmes in line with scientific knowledge, methodological efficiency, and the needs of our local community. The Faculty of Arts promises its students to remain a scientific beacon which will shine in the sky of science, knowledge, scientific research and community service.</p>
